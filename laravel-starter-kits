Laravel Breeze

Laravel Breeze is a minimal, simple implementation of all of Laravel's authentication features, including login, 
registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation. In addition, Breeze includes a simple 
"profile" page where the user may update their name, email address, and password.

Laravel Breeze's default view layer is made up of simple Blade templates styled with Tailwind CSS. Or, 
Breeze can scaffold your application using Vue or React and Inertia.

Breeze provides a wonderful starting point for beginning a fresh Laravel application and is also a great choice 
for projects that plan to take their Blade templates to the next level with Laravel Livewire.
